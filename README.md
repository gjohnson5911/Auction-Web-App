# Auction-Web-App
Rudimentary Ebay Clone

Users can create and delete auctions and bid on other user's auctions.
New users start with $1000 in their wallet. Once they bid on an item, the amount is removed from their wallet to prevent over-bidding.
When a bid ends, the winning bidder has the amount permanantly subtracted from their wallet and that amount is added to the seller's wallet.
